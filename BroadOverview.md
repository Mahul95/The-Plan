# The-Plan
An outline of my motivations, plans, and goals for myself programming-wise.

Motivations.
My main motivation for learning how to program is so that I can create solutions for my daily life. The prospect of being able to create solutions to daily occurences or even alternatives to existing practices is something which has interested me since I started learning. In addition to this, I hope that by leaarning how to program I will be able to have more freedom within my worklife, and outside of it. 

Plan.
I have been working on learning how to program using python for a little over a year. From studying courses, working on online exercises, and solving problems on sites like codewars and leetcode, I have developed a basic understanding of the syntax and approaches I can take utilise with python in order to create solutions. 

I now need to focus on creating projects. 
I will aim to start (and hopefully) finish 1 new coding project every week for the next year.
This, in conjunction with what I am studying from different sources, I hope will help to cement my understanding of coding concepts, best practices and syntax, as well as giving me the chance to develop more of an understanding as to how to approach projects, and what areas I need to work on.

Goal. 
To be able to use Git comfortably as part of my workflow.
To have a record of projects to my name.
To be able to apply for junior python developer/data science/analysis roles in April 2024.
